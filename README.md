# SKYNET-HACKATHON-PROJECT
James Webb Telescope and it's Event

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope designed primarily to conduct
 infrared astronomy. As the largest optical telescope in space, its high infrared 
 resolution and sensitivity allow it to view objects too early, distant, or faint 
 for the Hubble Space Telescope. This is expected to enable a broad range of 
 investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation
  of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric 
  characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets
